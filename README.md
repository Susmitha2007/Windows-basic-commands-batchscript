Create a batch file  on the desktop that checks whether a user-input number is odd or not. The script should:
Prompt the user to enter a number.
Calculate the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
Display whether the number is odd or not.
Ask the user if they want to check another number.
Repeat the process if the user enters Y, and exit with a thank-you message if the user enters N.
Handle invalid inputs for the continuation prompt (Y/N) gracefully.

Write a batch script to check whether a file named sample.txt exists in the current directory. If the file exists, display the message sample.txt exists. Otherwise, display sample.txt does not exist. Pause the script at the end to view the result.

Instructions:
Use the IF EXIST conditional statement.
Make sure the script works for files located in the same directory as the batch file.
Use pause to keep the command window open after displaying the message.
Expected Output (if the file exists):
